<p>Lazo keeps your code organized by breaking your code up into three main directories. In addition to these directories there are a few subdirectories and some naming conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>server</code> directories contain code that is only loaded and executed on the server, e.g., a model syncher. Code that resides in “server” and “node_modules” directories are never served to the client.</li>
<li><code>client</code> directories contain code that is only loaded and executed on the client, .e.g., CSS files or JavaScript widgets that rely on the DOM.</li>
<li>Code that resides outside of these directories is considered common code and will be loaded both on the server and the client.</li>
</ul>
<p>These naming conventions are used in conjunction with the Lazo module loader. A further breakdown of these main directories can be seen in the <a href="LazoComponent.md">components</a>, and <a href="LazoModel.md">models</a> documentation.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-shell">/app
Application level code such as application.js, CSS, and utility modules
